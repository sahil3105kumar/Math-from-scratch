# Math from Scratch: AI/ML & GSoC 2026 Foundations

This repository focuses on implementing fundamental mathematical concepts in **Pure Python** to demonstrate the deep algorithmic understanding required for high-level Open Source contributions.

## GSoC 2026 Strategy

I am currently preparing for **Google Summer of Code 2026** by building a strong foundation in:

* **Mathematical Modeling:** Translating theory (Linear Algebra/Calculus) into code.
* **Open Source Excellence:** Mastering the GitHub workflow (Branching, PRs, Documentation).
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Currently a **1000-rated competitive programmer** on Codeforces, working towards **1600 (Master)** to ensure high-performance code implementations.
* Here is the link to my codeforces :- https://codeforces.com/profile/itssahilhere31

## Target Organizations

I have joined the communities of the following organizations to track their 2026 project ideas:

* **Scikit-learn / NumFOCUS:** Focusing on Classical ML implementations.
* **mlpack:** Exploring C++/Python algorithm optimization.
* **TensorFlow / JAX:** Deepening knowledge of auto-differentiation and tensors.
